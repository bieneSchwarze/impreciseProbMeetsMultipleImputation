# Project: Imprecise Probability Meets Multiple Imputation

This is the joint repository of the SOEP/DIW group working on developing routines for multiple imputation and the imprecise probability team of the Statistics Departement of the LMU.
So far, to our knowledge, there exists no joint research bridging both fields.
As a first step, we work on figuring out similarities and differences of both approaches using a concrete example of income data collected together with same covariates in survey data.

A summary derived from ChatGPT (OpenAI, accessed 02.10.2024) about similarities of both approaches yields: Both approaches are used to handle uncertainty in data and decision-making. Here are the core similarities:<br>
*Dealing with Uncertainty*: Both methods aim to address uncertainty—multiple imputation deals with missing data by generating plausible values, while imprecise probability handles uncertainty in probability assessments by allowing for a range of possible probabilities rather than a single value.<br> 
*Use of Distributions*: In both approaches, distributions play a central role. Multiple imputation typically uses statistical models to generate multiple possible datasets, reflecting the uncertainty of the missing data. Imprecise probability works with sets of probability distributions to represent incomplete knowledge about a system.<br>
*Modeling Incomplete Information*: Both methodologies are designed to model incomplete or uncertain information, whether it’s about missing data in multiple imputation or the uncertainty in assigning precise probabilities in imprecise probability.<br>
*Multiple Outcomes*: Both techniques produce multiple possible outcomes to account for uncertainty. In multiple imputation, the results are pooled across several imputed datasets, while in imprecise probability, decisions are made based on a range of probable outcomes.<br>
*Robustness in Decision-Making*: The objective in both cases is to provide more robust statistical or probabilistic inferences. Multiple imputation reduces bias and improves estimates by incorporating uncertainty, while imprecise probability ensures decisions remain valid under ambiguity by avoiding overconfidence in a single probability estimate.<br>
In summary, both approaches offer flexible frameworks for dealing with uncertainty by generating multiple potential outcomes and using distributions to account for incomplete or imprecise information.
